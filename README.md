Hi, I'm Maxime.

With an economist and statistician research background - with a focus on energy and environment - I switched towards SEO consultancy and front-end engineering in 2021. For the story, I created this git account first to classify and share my work done on codecademy. But I had to pause the training to focus on SEO solutions development and launch my agency.

Feel free to reach me on astralrank.com.
